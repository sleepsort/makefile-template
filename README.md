# Makefile Templates

This repo manages makefile templates I used for my projects/experiments. Very helpful.

Two most fascinating features for a makefile-managed project are:

 * Auto-completion under shell environment:

   We can name commands like `make sort` to be `sort -nrk2 file.txt`, if those alias are classified with different prefixes, the auto-completion speed can be extremely fast.

 * Centralized scripts:

   For simpler tasks, tools like `sort`, `uniq`, `sed`, `awk` will be sufficient, and we won't have a dozen of scripts under project directories.
